* make test work...
* somehow set correct target-cpu depending on platform version
* Get i/o callibration data using OWL_SERVICE_GET_PARAMETERS service call
* Load resource files with OWL_SERVICE_LOAD_RESOURCE service call
## Maybe pile:
* Get system log / pow tables
* FFT init service calls with OWL_SERVICE_ARM_RFFT_FAST_INIT_F32 and OWL_SERVICE_ARM_CFFT_INIT_F32
